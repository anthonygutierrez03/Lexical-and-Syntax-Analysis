Overview
This assignment involves implementing a scanner and parser for the C-- programming language using lex (or flex) for scanning and yacc (or bison) for parsing. The primary goal is to handle lexical and syntax rules of C--, without delving into semantic analysis. The program will read from standard input (stdin) and write output to standard output (stdout), while error messages will be sent to standard error (stderr).

Components
Scanner: Implements the lexical analysis of C-- code.
Parser: Implements the syntax analysis of C-- code.
Scanner
General
The scanner is implemented as a function that returns tokens from the input stream. Each token is represented by a positive integer corresponding to the type of token or 0 for end-of-file. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers. Single-character tokens like ( and ; will have the value of their character constants.

Token Values
Token values are defined as macros to simplify the interface between the scanner and parser. These macros are generated using yacc -d to create a y.tab.h file, which is included in the scanner.

Comments and Whitespace
Comments: Skip comments silently. End-of-file within a comment is an error.
Whitespace: Skip whitespace characters silently.
Errors
Lexical errors are returned to the parser as the value of any unrecognized character.

Parser
General
The parser handles the syntax analysis of the C-- code. Transform the grammar as necessary to eliminate conflicts, except for the "dangling else" shift/reduce conflict and conflicts between error productions. Use yacc -v to generate y.output for conflict information.

Error Handling
Implement error handling and recovery for syntax errors, excluding semantic errors. Error messages must include specific details and at least a line number to help locate syntax problems. The parser should recover gracefully and continue processing after encountering syntax errors.

Invoking the Program
The program, named compile, reads from stdin and sends all output to stdout. Error messages are sent to stderr. The program functions as a syntax checker, silently accepting syntactically correct input and reporting syntax errors to stderr.

Usage Example
Copy code
cat foo.c | compile
Important Note
Do not modify the program to read from a file instead of stdin.

Files
scanner.l: Lex (or Flex) file for the scanner implementation.
parser.y: Yacc (or Bison) file for the parser implementation.
Makefile: Automates the build process, ensuring correct generation of necessary files and compilation of the program.
y.tab.h: Header file generated by yacc -d, containing macro definitions for token values.
y.output: File generated by yacc -v, providing information about parser conflicts.
Compilation and Execution
Compile the Program

Copy code
make
Run the Program

Copy code
cat foo.c | ./compile
Error Reporting
Syntax errors are reported to stderr with specific messages, including line numbers for easier debugging. Ensure that your error handling provides clear and concise information to the user.
